# PieMan

PieMan started out as a bit of fun to keep the work team occupied with the Christmas slowdown.  

I decided to have a little look at the new ES6 classes that evergreen browsers such as FireFox and Chrome (not IE, probably not Edge either) introduced and support natively.  

I guess I used it as a bit of a learning platform â€“ playing with both ES6 classes and graphic in a web browser.

Is this written in the best way possible... hell no

Could the way I have done something be better... sure.

Are their bugs in it... yes

In the future I think I may change this to use typescript and make the classes compatible with IE? 

Anyhoo enjoy.
